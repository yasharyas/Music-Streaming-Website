# OnePiece Music Website

This is a simple music website themed around the popular anime "One Piece." The website allows users to listen to a collection of One Piece-themed songs and offers basic playback control features. Below, you'll find a brief overview of the website's structure and functionality.

## Overview

The website consists of three main components: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. Let's take a closer look at each of them.

### index.html

This file defines the structure and layout of the website using HTML. It includes the following major sections:

1. Navigation Bar (`nav`): Contains the logo and menu items ("Home" and "About").
2. Song List (`div.songlist`): Displays a list of songs with their respective titles and play buttons.
3. Song Banner (`div.songBanner`): A banner section that could be used for advertisements or additional content.
4. Playbar (`div.bottom`): The playbar section displaying audio controls, the progress bar, and song information.

### style.css

This file contains the CSS styles for the website, defining how different elements should be displayed. It includes styles for the navigation bar, song list, playbar, and other elements, such as icons and progress bar.

### script.js

This JavaScript file handles the functionality of the website. It includes event listeners for various interactions, such as play/pause, progress bar updates, song selection, and previous/next song navigation.

## Functionality

The website provides the following functionality:

1. **Audio Playback**: Users can play and pause songs by clicking the play button in the song list or the play/pause icon in the playbar.
2. **Song Selection**: Users can click on any song in the song list to start playing that song.
3. **Next/Previous Song**: Users can navigate between songs using the next and previous buttons in the playbar.
4. **Progress Bar**: The progress bar at the bottom of the playbar shows the current position of the song and allows users to seek to different parts of the track.
5. **Song Information**: The playbar displays the name of the currently playing song.
6. **Sticky Playbar**: The playbar remains visible at the bottom of the page even when scrolling.

## Additional Notes

- The website uses Font Awesome icons for the play, pause, next, and previous buttons.
- The song information and progress bar are updated in real-time as the song plays.
- The website uses a background image for the main container, creating a visually appealing theme.

Please note that the website currently uses placeholder data (e.g., song names, cover images, and file paths) for demonstration purposes. To make it fully functional, you'll need to provide the actual song files and their respective cover images in the correct file paths.

Feel free to customize and improve the website according to your needs and preferences. Enjoy your One Piece-themed music experience!
